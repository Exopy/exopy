Atom and Enaml
==============

.. contents::

Atom
----

Atom allow to create memory efficient python object by specifying in the class
the members (rather than allowing dynamic attributes). Atom can also be used to
add type checking to object members. This goes against the notion of
duck-typing but tends to make the code easier to read. Note also that metadata
can be added to a member using the :py:meth:tag method. Metadata are
extensively used in Exopy.

.. note::

    For clarity sake and Python2/3 compatibility, Unicode should be used
    instead of Str.

Enaml
-----

.. todo::

    Need to describe the syntax for overriding declarative functions.
