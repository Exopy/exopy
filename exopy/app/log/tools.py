"""This module defines some tools to make easier the use of the logging module.

It provide tools to seamlessly convert stream information into log record so
that any `print` can get recorded, and others to process log emitted in a
subprocess.

    StreamToLogRedirector
        Simple class to redirect a stream to a logger.
    QueueHandler
        Logger handler putting records into a queue.
    GuiConsoleHandler
        Logger handler adding the message of a record to a GUI panel.
    QueueLoggerThread
        Thread getting log record from a queue and asking logging to handle
        them.
