"""Run this file with enaml-run command to manually check widget behavior.

Here the window is divided into two : on the left a tree widget is used to
display a hierarchic set of Folder and File objects, on the right is displayed
the widget associated with the currently selected object in the tree. A button
to re-initialise the tree is also availabla.
Action to test:
- when clicking on a tree node the widget on the right should immediately
  update.
- when right-cliking a node a menu should appear the available operations
  depend on the node :
  - root node :
    only Append should appear to add a new node. When clicked a
    dialog proposing to enter the name of the new node and its type should
    appear. Check that all buttons produce the expected result.
  - folder node :
    Add after, Add before, Append, Cut, Copy, Paste, Rename, Delete should
    appear. Make sure that everything does work and that copying and pasting in
    the same node does not cause any issue.
  - file node :
    Add after, Add before, Cut, Copy, Paste, Rename, Delete should appear.
    The name of the node should be followed by '(File)' when renaming the popup
    should not show it but the name after renaming should show it again.
- dragging and dropping is supported and should allow to change a File of
  Folder and to re-organise File inside a Folder (when doing this Moving should
  be printed to the console).
- changing the name of a file in the right panel should automatically be
  reflected on the tree.
- using the right panel widget to modify the order of the object should also be
  reflected on the tree.
